# NetLog

1.This is just a concept prove of the idea of a network maintenance activity log for the use of staff in the Networks unit of the Energy Information Systems Department, Energy Commission of Nigeria. I found a way to use Jade with Bootstrap, Express, NodeJS and MongoDB.

2. Because of the large data and restrictions on GIT for large file storage, only the barebones of the projects has been uploaded (and will be updated). Hence to run this application on your local machine:
  1. clone the repo
  2. cd to the root folder
  3. install dependencies
  4. create a folder for the database and launch MongoDB pointing dbpath to the created folder
  5. start npm on the root folder
  6. fire up a browser to the address http://localhost:3000/

3. I appreciate your contributions, via a pull request of course.
